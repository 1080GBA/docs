# Custom Extensions

TurboWarp supports sandboxed extensions specified via URL parameter, for example: https://turbowarp.org/editor?extension=https://extensions.turbowarp.org/fetch.js

This is an experimental feature.

Projects made using this feature are incompatible with Scratch and cannot be uploaded to the Scratch website. The extension must be loaded by TurboWarp using the same URL that it was saved with.

More documentation will be written at a future date.
