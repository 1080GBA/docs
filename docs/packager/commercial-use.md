# Can I sell projects made with the TurboWarp Packager?

If you have the rights to all the costumes, sounds, and scripts inside the project you package, you can sell it.

The open source components of Scratch and TurboWarp used by the packager are available under permissive open source licenses that allow you to use, modify, distribute, and sell your projects with almost no restrictions.

If you used costumes, sounds, or scripts created by other people, make sure you have permission from these people to sell their work. Anything you found on the Scratch website is available under the [CC BY-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/) license which technically doesn't prevent you from re-selling the work, but it requires attribution and the share-alike clause may have significant license implications on the rest of your project. Project creators can grant you additional permissions on top of the CC BY-SA 2.0 if they choose.

If you make money off of the packager, you are encouraged to [donate to us and the projects we rely upon](/donate). ❤️
