# Remove Miscellaneous Limits

Disables various limits that aren't significant enough to get a dedicated toggle.

 - Pitch and pan left/right sound effect range limit is removed
 - Blocks that set or change sound effect or volume levels run instantly instead of stopping the script for a full frame
 - Minimum pen size is reduced to 0 (normally 1) and maximum pen size (normally 1200) is removed
 - Mouse X and Y coordinates will not be rounded, useful in fullscreen or when using high quality pen

This list will be expanded over time.
