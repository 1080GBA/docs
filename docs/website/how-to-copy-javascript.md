# How to copy the JavaScript

## Short Answer {#short}

 * If you want to package/HTMLify TurboWarp, use https://packager.turbowarp.org/
 * If you want to convert Scratch projects to readable JavaScript, use https://leopardjs.vercel.app/

## Long Answer {#long}

The code generated by TurboWarp is not designed to be read or edited by humans. Attempting to do so would be actively harmful to one's learning because of the many unusual things done to improve compatability or performance.

For example, in regular JavaScript accessing a list item is as simple as `myList[myIndex]`, but TurboWarp does `(b1.value[(b0.value | 0) - 1] ?? "")` or `listGet(b0, b1.value)` depending on what assumptions it can make. `b0` and `b1` are real variable names that TurboWarp will use and `listGet` is a magic function that's part of the TurboWarp runtime. The code also lacks any formatting.
