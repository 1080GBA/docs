# Unshared projects are no longer visible

**Updated November 10, 2022** Unshared projects are no longer visible due to changes to the Scratch API.

This is a good thing. We'll update this page with more information soon.

You've had nearly 6 months notice to update your workflows, so hopefully you've done so by now.
