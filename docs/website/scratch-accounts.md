# Scratch Accounts & TurboWarp

You can't sign in to your Scratch account on TurboWarp. Any site other than scratch.mit.edu that asks for your Scratch password is trying to steal your Scratch account and delete all of your projects irrecoverably. There are no exceptions to this rule.

To change your username: Use the Edit > Change Username menu.

To upload a project made in TurboWarp to Scratch: use File > Save to your computer in TurboWarp's editor to save the project to your computer, and use File > Load from your computer in Scratch's editor to upload the file.

Even if you're signed in to Scratch in another tab, TurboWarp can't access it because browsers have tried very hard to prevent websites from being able to access login credentials of other websites. We would have to ask you for your Scratch password which would add unfixable security horrors.

We don't have our own place to upload projects because we can't invest the necessary time and resources to keep it alive long-term, and we doubt we can do a better job than Scratch. Depending on what you're trying to do, you might find success using the [TurboWarp Packager](https://packager.turbowarp.org/) to be able to upload your project to generic HTML or game hosting sites.
